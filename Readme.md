# chorus detection

This project implements the music chorus detection algorithm which presented in [1]. Then I have improved it in the step of diagonal detection of self-distance matrix.
This program depends [Essentia](http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/) to extract music feature, numpy to do some matrix operation and matplotlib for visualization.

The entry point is **main.py**.
